> **Abstract**: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency.

## üìñ About This Research

This paper offers a **cross-disciplinary synthesis** of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination.

### üéØ Key Contributions

- **Unified Framework**: Synthesizes insights from neuroscience, cognition, and AI to identify foundational principles for AGI system design
- **Critical Analysis**: Examines limitations of current token-level models and post hoc alignment strategies
- **Emergent Methods Survey**: Covers modular cognition, world modeling, neuro-symbolic reasoning, and biologically inspired architectures
- **Multidimensional Roadmap**: Presents a comprehensive path for AGI development incorporating logical reasoning, lifelong learning, embodiment, and ethical oversight
- **Cognitive Function Mapping**: Maps core human cognitive functions to computational analogues

## üß† Core Concepts

### Why Token-Level Prediction Alone is Insufficient for AGI

Current models like GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Grok capture surface linguistic patterns but fail to support complex mental representations grounded in the physical world. Lacking embodiment, causality, and self-reflection, they struggle with abstraction and goal-directed behavior‚Äîcore requirements for AGI.

### Beyond Scaling: The Need for Architectural Innovation

While scaling improves fluency and performance on many tasks, it cannot resolve core limitations of current LLMs. These models still lack:
- Grounded understanding
- Causal reasoning  
- Persistent memory
- Goal-directed behavior
